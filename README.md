# Visual Studio Code Insiders Portable 

Visual Studio Code is a mid-weight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).  

Visual Studio Code Insiders PortableApps.com edition is the Visual Studio Code Insiders application packaged with a PortableApps.com Launcher as a portable app. It supplies all the same features as Visual Studio Code Insiders. You can run it on a USB flash drive, or removable hard disk drive, without leaving personal information behind on that machine. 

 
## Known Issues 

This portable app cannot auto-upgrade by itself. A workaround is running the portable app installer again to download the latest version and overwrite the existing installation. 

This portable app is not fully clean if you installed VSCode extensions running code outside VSCode. For example, TabNine. There is no workaround for now.
